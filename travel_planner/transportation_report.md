The following is a suggested transportation plan for your Goa trip, based on the provided itinerary and information gathered from online searches.  Prices are estimates and may vary based on availability and booking time.

**Flights (March 23rd & 27th, 2025):**

*   This section requires more detail on your origin city to provide specific flight options and costs. Please provide your departure city to get accurate flight information.  Several airlines (Air India, IndiGo, etc.) service Goa. Check their websites (or use aggregators like Skyscanner, Expedia, etc.) for prices.  Remember to book in advance for better deals, particularly for a group of four.


**Intra-Goa Transportation:**

*   **Day 1:** Airport to Palolem (South Goa):  A pre-booked taxi is recommended due to the travel time (2-3 hours).  Expect to pay approximately ₹2,800 - ₹3,500.  Consider negotiating the fare beforehand.

*   **Day 3:** Palolem to Calangute/Baga (North Goa):  A taxi or pre-booked car will be the most convenient option for a group of four.  The fare will be around ₹2,200 - ₹3,400 for a sedan, potentially higher for an SUV.  Bus travel is possible but will take significantly longer (approximately 2.5-3 hours) and might be less comfortable.

*   **Day 4:** Old Goa/Panjim to Airport: Again, a taxi is the recommended choice for convenience and speed (1-2 hours).  The fare will depend on your exact location within Old Goa/Panjim, but expect a price range similar to the previous taxi journeys.


**Local Transport within Palolem/Patnem and Calangute/Baga:**  Taxis, auto-rickshaws, and local buses are readily available.  Scooters can also be rented for greater flexibility, especially in navigating the beaches.


**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pre-booking:** Booking flights and taxis in advance, especially during peak season (which March likely is), is highly recommended to secure the best prices and availability.
*   **Negotiation:** Always negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey.
*   **Group Discounts:** Inquire about potential group discounts when booking taxis or other transportation.
*   **Travel Time:**  Remember that travel times in Goa can be affected by traffic, especially during peak hours and tourist season. Add buffer time to your itinerary.



This plan provides a framework.  Use online booking platforms to secure the best fares and time slots for your flights and intra-Goa transport.  Remember to consider traffic conditions and potential delays when planning your daily activities.
